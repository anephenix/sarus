There are a number of ways to contribute to the project:

* Making feature requests
* Submitting new features
* Reporting bugs
* Adding and improving documentation
* General queries.

Below is a list of suggested ways to approach each:

### Making feature requests

Suggestions are welcome. The best way to make them is to [create an issue](https://github.com/anephenix/sarus/issues/new), and add the label "enhancement" to it.

We will then take a look and see what we can do about it.

### Submitting new features

If you have a feature that you think would be good to include in Sarus, then that suggestion is welcome too.

Again, [create an issue](https://github.com/anephenix/sarus/issues/new), and add the label "enhancement".

If the new feature is given the thumbs up, submit a Pull Request to the repo with the code for it.

### Reporting bugs

We try hard to prevent any bugs from occurring in Sarus, but that doesn't guarantee that they won't happen. 

If you come across a bug and wish to report it, [create an issue](https://github.com/anephenix/sarus/issues/new) and add the label "bug".

If you have a way to replicate the error, please provide as much detail as possible in the issue. That will help with finding a way to fix it.

### Adding and improving documentation

You can make additions and improvements to the documentation via submitting a Pull Request.

### General queries

[create an issue](https://github.com/anephenix/sarus/issues/new), and add the label "question".
